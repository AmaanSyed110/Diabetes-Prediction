# Diabetes Prediction
## Description
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model capable of classifying whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not, based on various relevant health and demographic factors. By leveraging advanced predictive modeling techniques and harnessing the power of data, this project aims to provide a reliable and efficient means of early detection and risk assessment for diabetes.
